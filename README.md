Orientation Fix in PHP
=====================

This is a quick PHP script i cobbled together (as you can tell) to fix the orientation of images taken on many smart phones and the like for a stackoverflow user.

This is not intended at this stage to be a finished, production ready, refined script. But it instead provides the core basis for "doing the job" and you should edit it to get it working to your requirements (i.e. How it loads and saves the files).

If you use this script, then let me know at i-played-with-your-git[at]secure4sure[dot]org, if i find there's actually a good number of people interested in it, i might spend some time cleaning it up and possibly OOPing it (although i think if you want OOP this up, you should be integrating it into your own image classes and not uses an independant one for something relatively small).

Currently this uses GD (as i know it off the top of my head, and works good enough). Once again if you really want an Imagick version, drop me an email or even make it yourself and share it with the world!

Hopefully someone finds it useful :)
